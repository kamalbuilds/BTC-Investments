# Runes Mock Bridge

This project is an open-source proof of concept implementing a Runes Mock Bridge. The primary goal is to allow users to etch (and eventually mint) Runes on the Bitcoin network and create a 1:1 representation of these Runes as ERC1155 tokens (Non fungible initially) on the Rootstock (RSK) network, manage the runes in the RSK network, and then take it back to BTC.

## Overview

The Runes Mock Bridge consists of various processes:

1. **Etching Runes on Bitcoin**: Users can etch Runes containing data entered through a form. A signer instantiated on Rootstock signs the transaction, creating the Rune without the user needing to sign any transactions directly.
2. **Creating ERC1155 Representation on RSK**: Once a Rune is etched on Bitcoin, the system calls an ERC1155 function to mint the Rune on the RSK network. The token's information is based on the user's input for the Rune. The user receives the specified amount of tokens in a "premine" specified during the Rune creation.
3. **Transfer, manage, and interact with RSK runes representation** : Users can transfer, manage, and interact with the ERC1155 representation of the Rune on the RSK network.
4. **Redeeming Runes**: Users can redeem the ERC1155 tokens on RSK to etch the Rune back on Bitcoin. The system freezes the ERC1155 tokens and sends the Rune back to the user's Bitcoin address.

## Installation

To clone and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rsksmart/rsk-runes.git
   cd rsk-runes
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   yarn
   or
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables. Example:

   ```sh
   RSK_PROVIDER_URL="https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"
   PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PK='your-private-key'
   NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL='your rsk rpc url'
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EXPLORER_URL=https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx
   NEXT_PUBLIC_RSK_EXPLORER_URL=https://explorer.testnet.rootstock.io/tx
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS='your erc1155 contract address'
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TAPROOT_ADDRESS='your taproot address'
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WIF='your wif key'
   ```

4. **Run the development server**:

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   or
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

1. **Access the application**: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
2. **Etch a Rune**: Navigate to the Etch tab, fill out the form, and submit to etch a Rune on Bitcoin.
3. **View ERC20 Representation**: After etching, view the ERC1155 token details on the Last Etch tab.

## Future Development

- **Minting Runes**: The minting functionality is under development and will be available in future releases.
- **Fungible Tokens on RSK**: The project will support the creation of fungible tokens on the RSK network.
